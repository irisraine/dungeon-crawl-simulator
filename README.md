# Dungeon Crawl Simulator

## Description

**ASTON LEARNING COURSE :: HOMEWORK â„– 1**

A learning project that imitates classic old text dungeon crawlers 
in a simplified and fully automatic format. It is a text-based, automated dungeon crawler game where a 
trio of heroes (Warrior, Mage, and Archer) faces off against various groups of enemies. The game runs 
automatically, with heroes and enemies choosing targets randomly at each turn. The game ends when the 
party is either killed by the enemies or decides to stop fighting.

## How to use

Firstly, create an executable JAR file using Maven (you must have Maven installed on your system). To do this, run the following command in the project parent directory:

`mvn clean package`

After that, you can run the game using the command:

`java -jar target/dungeon-crawl-simulator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Or alternatively, you can just click and run the builded JAR executable.
