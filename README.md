Welcome to Dungeon Crawl Simulator, a learning project that imitates classic old text dungeon crawlers 
in a simplified and fully automatic format. It is a text-based, automated dungeon crawler game where a 
trio of heroes (Warrior, Mage, and Archer) faces off against various groups of enemies. The game runs 
automatically, with heroes and enemies choosing targets randomly at each turn. The game ends when the 
party is either killed by the enemies or decides to stop fighting.
